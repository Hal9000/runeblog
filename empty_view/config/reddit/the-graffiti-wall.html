RIP, Hope Gallery

 
<div class='mydrop'>I</div>
<div style="padding-top: 1px">t's been a while since I was there. They say it was torn down
while I wasn't looking. Never tagged anything there, of course, nor
anywhere else. Spraypainting public places isn't my thing, but in this
case I condoned it because it was sort of there for that purpose.

This fake entry is a long one so as to demonstrate both drop-caps
(above) and an inset quote. Blah blah blah. Lorem ipsum dolor and
a partridge in a pear tree.

Wherever you go, there you are. Last night I saw upon the stair
a little man who was not there. He wasn't there again today; I
wish, I wish he'd go away.  As far as we know, our computer has 
<div style='float:left; width: 20%; padding:8px; padding-right:12px'><b><i> On a clean disk, you can seek forever.</i></b></div>
never had an undetected error.  
 On a clean disk, you can seek forever.
And never let it be denied that 
pobbles are happier without their toes. And may your snark never 
be a boojum. How do you know you aren't dreaming right now? When
you see a butterfly, think of Chuang Tzu.

Contact light. Houston, this is Tranquility Base. The Eagle has
landed. That's one small step for (a) man, one giant leap for 
mankind.

Pity this busy monster, manunkind, not. Pity rather... Listen:
There's a hell of a universe next door; let's go.
