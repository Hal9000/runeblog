Problem: How to handle assets?
  - avoid duplicating them
  - hierarchy? global, view, post?
  - upload as needed
  - flag when missing
  - keep manifests?
  - use a .asset command?
  - assets directories at each level?



Logic:
  Post is being published
  Asset reference is detected
  Check if there's already a local one?
  Check the view?
  Check global?
  If not available, complain
  If available, handle in publish *and* deploy
  Write to manifest?
  Asset inheritance depends on deployment server?
